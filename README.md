# Internship_Task_1
Summary:

In this task, I cleaned and prepared the Netflix dataset by addressing key data quality issues. I handled missing values using appropriate imputation techniques, removed duplicate records, and standardized text values like country names. Date columns were converted to a consistent format (dd-mm-yyyy), and column headers were renamed to be lowercase and space-free. I also checked and corrected data types (e.g., ensuring numerical columns were in the correct format). The dataset is now clean, structured, and ready for further analysis or modeling
